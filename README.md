# PTIMP-proposal
This repository contains a speculative propulsion architecture that explores the use of poly-isotopic methane fuels (CH₄, CH₃D, CD₄, etc.) for enhanced control, precision, and performance in advanced rocket systems. The work originated as a meditation on vibrational modes of molecules, energy distribution, and AI-augmented systems thinking.
