# PTIMP: Precision-Throttled Isotopic Methane Propulsion

## Overview

PTIMP is a speculative propulsion architecture exploring the use of poly-isotopic methane fuels (CH₄, CH₃D, CD₄, etc.) to enhance control, precision, and performance in advanced rocket systems. Originating from an analysis of molecular vibrational modes, energy distribution, and AI-augmented systems thinking, this project aims to address challenges in engine durability and reusability.

## Motivation

Recent analyses indicate that even advanced methane-fueled engines like SpaceX's Raptor can produce soot under certain conditions, impacting engine longevity and maintenance requirements. By leveraging isotopically enriched methane, such as CD₄, we aim to:

- **Reduce Soot Formation**: CD₄'s altered vibrational properties may lead to cleaner combustion, minimizing soot production.
- **Enhance Engine Durability**: Cleaner combustion can decrease wear on engine components, extending operational life.
- **Improve Reusability**: Reduced maintenance between flights supports rapid turnaround and cost-effective operations.

## Key Concepts

- **Vibrational Modes**: Investigating how isotopic substitution affects molecular vibrations and combustion characteristics.
- **Quantum Oscillators**: Modeling fuel molecules as quantum harmonic oscillators to predict energy distribution during combustion.
- **Spring/Collision Dynamics**: Analyzing molecular interactions to understand and optimize combustion processes.
