**Precision-Throttled Isotopic Methane Propulsion**

This repository contains a speculative propulsion architecture that explores the use of poly-isotopic methane fuels (CH₄, CH₃D, CD₄, etc.) for enhanced control, precision, and performance in advanced rocket systems. The work originated as a meditation on vibrational modes of molecules, energy distribution, and AI-augmented systems thinking.

## Core Themes

- Vibrational mode resonance tuning across isotopic variants
- Phase-specific fuel mixing for emergency and precision maneuvers
- Quantum-informed thrust modulation concepts
- Cold War-inspired chaos engineering adapted to modern propulsion
- Metacognitive and AI-assisted engineering workflows

## Key Artifact

- `Sturgeon_PTIMP_Propulsion_Proposal_v4.docx` – full write-up of the conceptual framework and speculative use cases.
